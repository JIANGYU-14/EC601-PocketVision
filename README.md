# PocketVision

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our iOS application, PocketVision.
    
PocketVision is meant to be an application that combines both social networking, object tracking and object recognition for blind and sighted users to use. Since the beginning of the project, each of these functions has been developed by different teams across different branches. We feel that more work needs to be done on all three functions before a complete integration of them into one application. As a result, you will have to build the three functions seperately to use them at this point.


Under <> branch, you will find the build instructions for the Object Tracking part.

Under <> branch, you will find the build instructions for the Object Recognition part.

Lastly, you will find the build instructions for the Social Networking part below (master):

:highlight Build Instructions for PocketVision (Social network): gui=bold

1. Under master branch, "Clone or download" the entire repository onto your local machine.

2. Navigate to the folder you just cloned and Launch "PocketVision.xcworkspace" using Xcode 8.0 or above.

3. Select iPhone 7 in the "iOS Simulators" dropdown menu.

4. Click the "Play" button to build and run the application.

5. Since PocketVision is designed to be a social network, you need two phones to fully experience the application. To do so, you can install another copy of PocketVision onto an iOS device (iOS 10 or above).

There will be new updates and fuctions coming to the social networking part of PocketVision soon, but it is fully functional at this moment!
