# PocketVision

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our iOS application, PocketVision.
    
1. The social network and Object recognition part is in the master branch

2. The object tracking part is in the yaqin branch (becuase it is not 100 percent finished, so we decide to not push to the master branch)

Build Instructions for PocketVision (Social network):

1. Under master branch, "Clone or download" the entire repository onto your local machine.

2. Navigate to the folder you just cloned and Launch "PocketVision.xcworkspace" using Xcode 8.0 or above.

3. Select iPhone 7 in the "iOS Simulators" dropdown menu.

4. Click the "Play" button to build and run the application.

5. Since PocketVision is designed to be a social network, you need two phones to fully experience the application. To do so, you can install another copy of PocketVision onto an iOS device (iOS 10 or above).
